          <h2 align="center"><u>Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi</u></h2>
          <p><b><i>
            Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi was a Libyan politician and political theorist who is well known for his 42-year-long reign leading to his assassination. He took control of the Libyan government in 1969 and went on to rule the country as a dictator until 2011 when he was overthrown and killed. He was born in Bedouin in Sirte, Libya in 1942 and went on to join the military in the city of Benghazi during his youth. He staged a successful military coup in 1969 against King Idris. After overthrowing King Idris, Gaddafi was named the commander in chief of the armed forces and the chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. He rose to power through his Arab nationalist rhetoric and socialist-style policies which resonated with the majority of the Libyan population.
          </i></b></p>
          <p><b><i>
            Gaddafi was dissatisfied with the amount of power and influence that foreign countries had in the politics and economics of Libya. Thus after getting into power, Gaddafi went on to shut down the American and British military bases. He also changed the state of the oil industry, making it mandatory for foreign companies to share most of their revenue with the country in one way or another. After a failed military coup in 1969 that was aimed on replacing him, Gaddafi put into place laws that criminalized political dissent and thus taking his first steps on the path of totalitarianism. In 1970, Gaddafi published a book named Green Book that was a blueprint of his political philosophies and policies. In the book, he points out on the problems of democracy and capitalism and gives his policies as the solution to all these problems. For more information, see the Green book embedded below.
          </i></b></p>
          <p><b><i>
            Gaddafi who started out as a revolutionary, later on fell out of favor of the Libyan population as a result of his corruption acts, interference in foreign politics and human rights abuse.
          </i></b></p>
          <p><b><i>
            After gaining power, Gaddafi’s method of ruling was based on his role model Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Pan-Arab leader of Egypt. But after failing to gain support among the Arab countries for him to get such a role, Gaddafi turned his attention to Africa and sought out to create an analogous Pan-Africa movement. In his bid to start the Pan-Africa, Gaddafi had a goal of establishing an all-African army as well as a monetary union that would fund such endeavors as well as benefiting all the member countries. Using his own money (or his country’s money for that matter), he invested throughout Africa in business like hotels, mobile phone companies, and mining companies. Gaddafi also attempted 7 regional integration schemes and all in vain. The closest he became to attain his dream in his appointment as the African Union (AU) chairperson. Despite all his actions and efforts, Gaddafi was viewed with suspicion among the African leaders and they did not give him the opportunity to have it his way.
